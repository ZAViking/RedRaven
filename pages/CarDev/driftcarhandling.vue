    Turning a normal car into a drift car in FiveM involves tweaking the vehicle's handling file. Here's how you can adjust the handling to make a car drift-friendly:

    Key Handling Values to Adjust:
    Traction Curve:

    fTractionCurveMax: Lowering this value reduces the carâ€™s grip, making it easier to slide. Start by reducing it to around 1.5 to 2.5.
    fTractionCurveMin: This controls the minimum traction when the car is sliding. A lower value will help the car maintain the drift. Set this between 1.0 to 1.5.
    fTractionCurveLateral: This adjusts how the car reacts when turning. A higher value increases grip, while a lower one allows more drift. Adjust this based on how sharp you want the car to drift.
    Traction Bias:

    fTractionBiasFront: Adjust this to move the traction balance towards the rear wheels. A value of around 0.45 to 0.48 is good for drifting.
    Traction Loss:

    fLowSpeedTractionLossMult: Increase this value to make the car lose traction more easily at lower speeds. Values between 1.0 to 1.5 are typical for drift cars.
    Suspension:

    fSuspensionReboundDamp and fSuspensionCompDamp: Lower these values to make the car more bouncy, which can help with initiating drifts. Start by reducing them by 25% from the original values.
    Steering:

    fSteeringLock: Increasing this allows the wheels to turn more, giving better control during drifts. Set it between 40.0 to 50.0.
    Braking:

    fBrakeBiasFront: Adjusting this towards the rear (e.g., 0.4 to 0.45) can help maintain a drift when using the handbrake.
    fHandBrakeForce: Increase this value to make the handbrake more effective for initiating drifts. A value between 1.5 to 2.0 is recommended.
    Engine:

    fInitialDriveForce: Adjust this to provide more power to the wheels, helping the car maintain a drift. Increase this by around 10-20%.
    fDriveBiasFront: This should be close to 0.0 for rear-wheel drive or adjusted slightly if you want some front-wheel pull.</P>

<p>Testing and Tuning:
Test the car: After applying these changes, test the car in different scenarios to see how it behaves. Adjust the values according to how much drift you want.
Fine-tune: Drift setups can vary greatly depending on the car, so you may need to fine-tune each parameter until it feels right.</p>
